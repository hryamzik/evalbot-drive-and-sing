# Evalbot drive-and-sing

This project is based on `qs-autonomous` demo for evalbot and is designed to bring ability to play more sounds by either utilizing [SD slot](http://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/other/f/908/p/169023/1084999?pi239031350=1&pi320098=3) ([alternative](https://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/other/f/908/t/357655?Wave-Player)) and/or using `mp3` files instead of `wav` ones.

## Build

`make clean all`

## Flashing

I have to flash my evalbot from a windows VM using `LM Flash Programmer` as FTDI drivers for Mac don't recognise evalbot.
