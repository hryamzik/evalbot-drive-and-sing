# Evalbot drive-and-sing

This project is based on `qs-autonomous` demo for evalbot and is designed to bring ability to play more sounds by either utilizing SD slot and/or using `mp3` files instead of `wav` ones.

## Build

`make clean all`

## Flashing

I have to flash my evalbot from a windows VM using `LM Flash Programmer` as FTDI drivers for Mac don't recognise evalbot.
